# CarSensor
Version 1.1.0 - alpha build : 228ae81 

This is a C++ Project that creates a GUI based tool which shows range sensor data.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Using an Ardunio Uno and JSN-SR04T Ultrasonic Sensors to detect ranges in real time.
This is then sent via Serial (UART) to a Raspberry Pi Running a QT Built GUI application.
The Application displays the information to the user on a portable screen in the form of two bars.
Each bar adjusts its size and colour to indicate the distance the sensor is from a nearby object.
